        "description": "Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci (1881\u20131953) in Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci (son of Guccio), Gucci became a global brand, and was considered emblematic of the Italian economic miracle. Following family feuds during the 1980s, the Gucci family was entirely ousted from the capital of the company by 1993. After this crisis, the brand was revived and in 1999 Gucci became a subsidiary of the French conglomerate PPR, which later renamed itself to Kering.",
